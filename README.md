This file explains how to run the codes in this repository.

These are MATLAB code for discrete Wavelet Transform analysis for fault detecting.
The conde are for a distance protection scheme and for a differential protection scheme.

To run the code you need:
1. MATLAB
2. Arduino Nano 3.0, interfaced with an LCD
3. USB mini to connect the Arduino to the host computer

The MATLAB being run must have the following addons:
1. MATLAB Embedded Coder
2. MATLAB Support Package for Arduino Hardware
3. MATLAB LCD Addon,for the LCD interface
